## Final Project: Allstate Purchase Prediction Challenge on Kaggle

Here is the [current draft of my paper](allstate-paper.md). I expect the final version to be largely the same, except I'll expand the "Model Building" section and fill out the "Results" and "Conclusion" sections. I'll also add my code and presentation slides.

I'll make this a public repo as soon as the competition ends, which is May 19 at 8pm Eastern Time.
