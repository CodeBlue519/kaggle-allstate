## Kaggle: Allstate Purchase Prediction Challenge

For my final project with the [General Assembly Data Science](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science) class [in DC](https://github.com/ajschumacher/gadsdc), I competed in Kaggle's [Allstate Purchase Prediction Challenge](http://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-purchase-prediction-challenge).

* [Project paper](allstate-paper.md) (Markdown document)
* [Project presentation](allstate-presentation.pdf) (PDF)
* [R code](allstate-code.R)

Per the competition rules surrounding the sharing of code, I created this as a private repository and did not make it public until after the competition ended on May 19.
