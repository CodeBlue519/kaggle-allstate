## Allstate Purchase Prediction Challenge

For my [General Assembly Data Science](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science) class project, I competed in [Kaggle's Allstate Purchase Prediction Challenge](http://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-purchase-prediction-challenge).

* [Project paper](allstate-paper.md) (Markdown document)
* [Presentation slides](https://speakerdeck.com/justmarkham/allstate-purchase-prediction-challenge-on-kaggle) (on Speaker Deck website)
* [R code](allstate-code.R)

Per the competition rules surrounding the sharing of code, I created this as a private repository and did not make it public until after the competition ended on May 19.
